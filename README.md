# IDP React Demo Project

Imitates google form (Answer side) as a demo project to show how I manage the components and form.

## Required Techs

1. node.js v22.13.1
2. npm v11.1.0

## Step to test the demo

1. Clone the project
2. Open a command line tool (iTerm, terminal) and change directory to the repository
3. Use npm i command in the project directory
4. After finished installing packages, use npm start command to run the server
5. Your default browser will automatically open the web by localhost:3000 address

Note: The displaying form is of the answer side and the type and questions are fixed. Nothing you input is kept and there is no connection to any backend server.

Note2:  You can check the submitted value object in the browserâ€™s console (Inspect before submit is required).
